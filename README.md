PortfolioWebsite
A portfolio website to showcase my work and skills in computer hardware. 
The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
and I utilized a responsive design to ensure that it looks great on any device. 
I also included a section for my resume and contact information, so that potential employers or clients can easily get in touch with me.

I was particularly proud of the design and layout of the site, which I believe effectively showcases my work. 
I used a clean and modern design, with a focus on simplicity and user experience. 
I will also included a gallery of my completed projects, along with detailed descriptions of each one, 
so that visitors can get a sense of the scope and variety of my work.
